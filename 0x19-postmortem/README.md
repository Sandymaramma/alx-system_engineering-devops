# Postmortem: Outage in Web Application

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 4, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 4, 2023, 2:00 PM (PST)
Impact: The web application experienced downtime, resulting in an inability for users to access the service.
Approximately 30% of users were affected, leading to significant customer dissatisfaction and loss of potential business opportunities.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was initially detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden spike in error rates and a decrease in API response times.
10:05 AM: The engineering team received automated alerts about the abnormal server behavior.
10:10 AM: Engineers started investigating the issue, focusing on the backend server infrastructure and network connectivity.
10:30 AM: Initial assumption was that the issue might be related to the database, so the database servers were thoroughly checked for any anomalies.
11:00 AM: Investigations into the database didn't reveal any issues. Attention was then shifted to the load balancer configuration.
11:30 AM: After examining the load balancer logs, it was determined that the issue did not originate from the load balancer.
12:00 PM: As a last resort, the team inspected the application logs, where they discovered the unhandled exception causing the server crashes.
12:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the backend development team and the infrastructure team.
1:00 PM: The root cause of the issue was identified as a race condition in a critical code path of the backend API.
1:30 PM: The backend development team implemented a hotfix to address the race condition and prevent server crashes.
2:00 PM: The hotfix was deployed, and the web application was fully restored to normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a race condition occurring in a critical code path of the backend API. Under certain load conditions, multiple threads were accessing and modifying shared resources simultaneously, leading to an unhandled exception and subsequent server crashes. The issue was fixed by implementing appropriate synchronization mechanisms and locking strategies to ensure thread safety and prevent the race condition from occurring.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve Code Review Process: Enhance the code review process to specifically focus on identifying potential race conditions and ensuring proper synchronization techniques are applied.
Increase Load Testing: Conduct comprehensive load testing scenarios to identify and address any performance bottlenecks and uncover race conditions under heavy load.
Enhance Monitoring and Alerting: Implement more granular monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect abnormal error rates, response times, and server crashes.
Improve Logging and Error Handling: Enhance logging and error handling mechanisms to capture and handle unhandled exceptions more effectively, providing better visibility into critical issues.
Incident Response Training: Conduct regular incident response training sessions to ensure swift detection, investigation, and resolution of issues, and improve overall response time.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Apply code changes to incorporate proper synchronization mechanisms in the critical code path.
Conduct load testing with various scenarios and user loads to ensure the fix resolves the issue under different conditions.
Enhance monitoring and alerting system to include additional metrics for error rates, response times, and server health.
Review and update the code review process to include a checklist for identifying and mitigating race conditions.
Improve logging and error handling mechanisms to capture and report unhandled exceptions effectively.
By implementing these corrective measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to prevent similar out
