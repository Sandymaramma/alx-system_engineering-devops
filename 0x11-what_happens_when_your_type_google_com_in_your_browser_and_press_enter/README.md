Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.

A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

Requirements
General

Manual QA Review


The diagram should show:

DNS resolution

that the web server answers the request by serving a web page
that the application server generates the web page
that the application server request data from the database
Gliffy is free and what I personally use, but feel free to use what fits you best.
